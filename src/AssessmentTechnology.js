                                Assessments have become a valuable talent management tool throughout the entire employee experience.  Unfortunately, this also creates a significant challenge for talent management professionals who have to jump from one assessment platform to another.  What if you could manage all of your assessments from one platform?

                        Our assessment solution is used for both talent acquisition and development purposes. Whether you have a high-volume hiring event or an internal development program, our platform integrates multiple assessment vendors, proprietary assessments, or competencies in a simple dashboard with just the information you need. The result is an efficient assessment process based on your evaluation framework and competency models that helps you screen and select the right talent in a fraction of the time. For programs that focus on talent development for existing employees, the dashboard can be used to lessen burden of test administration, track assessment completion progress, and store several reports in one participant record.
